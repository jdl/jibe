# Jibe

An elixir library for comparing an arbitralily nested map/list against a pattern.

This is intended as a helper in unit tests, but there's nothing forcing that to be
the case. It's just a simple set of elixir functions that could be called from anywhere. 

See `jibe.ex` for examples.

## Installation
